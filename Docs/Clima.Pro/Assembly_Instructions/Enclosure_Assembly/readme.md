# Clima.Pro 3D Printed Enclosure Assembly

If you've ordered the enclosure from the Wilderness Labs store, it already comes assembled with the heat-set inserts in it, so you can skip this step and go directly to [Electronics Installation instructions](../Electronics_Installation/readme.md).

However, if you're 3D printing at home, you'll need to follow the instructions below:

## Post-process 3D Print

Stringing and burrs are a by-product of printing with PETG and are mostly cosmetic, but can easily be cleaned off with a box-cutter knife, razor blade, or similar.

## Install M3 Heat-Set Inserts into Enclosure Body

Install a heat-set insert tool into your soldering iron, plug it in and turn it on. After a couple of minutes it should be hot enough. Place an M3 heat-set insert onto the end of the tool, being careful not to touch the hot tip:

Then, while holding the enclosure, guide the insert into one of the holes until it's just flush with the top of the hole:

Repeat this for all four heat set inserts on the main enclosure body.

## Plunge Excess Plastic from Heat-Set Inserts

Install an M3 bolt through the M3 insert from the inside of the enclosure, to push any plastic that might have melted into the insert:

Screw the bolt far enough that it pokes out the other side of the insert and pushes out the plastic:

Remove the bolt and repeat for the remaining M3 inserts.

Once all four have been plungd, using a knife, trim the excess plastic:

## Install the M3 Heat-Set Inserts into the Enclosure Mount

Using the same method, install (4), M3 inserts into the enclosure mount from the backside, and then push excess plastic out with a bolt and trim:

## Install the M2 Heat-Set Inserts into the Enclosure Body

Finally, install the M2 heat-set inserts for the lid into the enclosure body:
